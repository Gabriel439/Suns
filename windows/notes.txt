In order to make the pika Windows installer, I simply downloaded the 
source code for pika from github, and then:
1) Create a file called "config" and tell what version of Ubuntu you're targetting:

[DEFAULT]
Suite: precise

2) Then run
python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb


That will create the deb file in the bdist_deb directory.
