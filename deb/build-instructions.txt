First, check to see if this package name is already taken.
aptitude show suns-search

Next, create an empty package file.
equivs-control suns-search

Then, modify this file to describe where to install the files.

Finally, build the deb.
equivs-build suns-search

To make the pika deb, download the tarball and extract the directory.
Create a file called "config" and tell what version of Ubuntu you're targetting:

[DEFAULT]
Suite: precise

Then run 
python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb

That will create the deb file in the bdist_deb directory.
